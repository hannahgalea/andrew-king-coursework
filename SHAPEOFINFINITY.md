# The Shape of Infinity

Wasn't too keen on the way the narative was presented, in that his was of speaking alluded to his research being fact rather than his oppinion. 

*The Shape of Infinity* by Jacob Geller is a commentry on William Chyr's game *Manifold Garden*, which is a form of visual representation of an infinite space. There are many possible sources of inspirtation that Chyr turned to in order to create this game. The most prominent one, as explained by Geller, is Susanna Clarke's novel *Piranesi*, which depicts a disorienting alternate reality setting.

Visually, the first thought that came to mind when watching *The Shape of Infinity*, were the patterns created through cellular automata. These patterns are usually built on a finite 2D plain but can also be used to create an infinite simulation, all done using rules. Stephen Wolfram managed to categorise these patterns generated by binary code into four classes with the most interesting being class three and four. Class three generates psudo randomness and whereas class four generates a mixture of order and randomness. The paper *Infinite Time Cellular Automata: a Real Computation Model*' by Fabien Givors, Grégory Lafitte, Nicolas Ollinger, investigates the infinite time cellular automata as a transfinite computation model to create infinite time turning machines.

I think Chyr's "Manifold Garden" was made using the cellular automata laws to produce chaos, order, and unpredictability, creating an infinite and unsettling virtual environment.


#### So ultimatly, was math invented or discovered? 

Infinity is a difficult concept for the human mind to grasp. The game, however, provides a fantastic idea of what an infinite space may be like. This is just one person's interpretation of the idea of infinity, which has existed throughout history in a variety of manifestations, including literature, philosophy, architecture, theologies and mythologies, sculptures, artwork, and architecture. In Norse Mythology the ouroboros presents itself as the serpent Jörmungandr that was said to be so big that it encircled the world and grasped its tail between its teeth. This symbolised the concept of eternity and endless return. Ths symbol was even earlier seen in Anciet Egypt and Greece.

So, although the game simulates an infinite space, it is practically impossible to reproduce genuine infinity since it relies on a machine that eventually stops running and is constructed of finite materials.

In an effort to arouse various emotions in the viewer, artists have always strived to push the limits of perspective. Repetition is the most popular strategy for comprehending 2D visual depictions of infinity or limitless perspectives. This has been proven historically in a range of forms and media.

In the pictures above we can see the jump from the Renaissance period seen in Raphael's *School of Athens*, to Boullee's *Architectural Review* in the Neoclassical period. All artists used different point perspectives to acheive the desired scale and size, successfully eliciting a sence of insignificance and disorientation in the viewer.
